  <h1>This is a simple Express.js server application that serves HTML files to users and validates form submissions. Here's a breakdown:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Importing required modules: The necessary modules are imported at the beginning of the script, including express for creating the web server, body-parser for handling form submissions, and path-related functions for handling file paths.</li>
    <li>Setting up constants: The server port and a secret password ("TopSecret") are set up as constants. The __dirname constant is set up to refer to the directory where the script is located.</li>
    <li>Configuring the application: The Express.js application is created, and body-parser middleware is configured to handle URL-encoded form submissions.</li>
    <li>Setting up routes:
      A GET route is set up for the root ("/") URL. When users access the root URL, the server sends them an index.html file located in the /public directory.
      A POST route is set up for the "/check" URL. This route is intended to handle form submissions from the index.html page. It checks if the password submitted in the form matches the secret password. If it does, the server sends a secret.html file; if not, it redirects the user back to the index.html page.</li>
    <li>Starting the server: The server is configured to listen on the specified port, and when it starts, a message is logged to the console.</li>
  </ul>
